# Assingment3-SLLandSerialization

School project for educational purposes and learing data structure. It implements Singly Linked List (SLL), Serialization and Testing in C#. This projects includes various SLL operations such as addition, removal, searching, and serialization/deserialization capabilities of elements in SLL.


## Features

- IsEmpty: Checks if the list is empty.
- Clear: Clears all elements from the list.
- Count: Returns the number of elements in the list.
- AddFirst: Adds an element at the beginning of the list.
- AddLast: Adds an element at the end of the list.
- Add: Adds an element at the specified index of the list.
- Replace: Replaces the element at a specified index with a new value.
- RemoveFirst: Removes the first element from the list.
- RemoveLast: Removes the last element from the list.
- Remove: Removes an element at a specified index from the list.
- GetValue: Retrieves the value of the element at a specified index.
- IndexOf: Finds the index of the first occurrence of a value in the list.
- Contains: Checks if an element exists in the list.


## Key Features

- Dynamic Data Structure: Efficiently manage collections of items with dynamic resizing.
- Extensive Operations Support: Includes methods for adding elements at the beginning or end, removing elements, checking if the list is empty, finding elements, and more.
- Unit Tests: Comprehensive NUnit tests ensure reliability and correctness of the implemented functionality.
- Serialization Support: Easily serialize and deserialize the linked list to/from binary format for storage or transmission.
